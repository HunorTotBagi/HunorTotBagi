    <h1>Hi, I'm Hunor 👋</h1>
    <p>
      I hold a <strong>Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics</strong>, but my passion for problem-solving led me to the world of <strong>Software Development</strong>. I love working with technologies like C#, .NET, Java, Python. My passion lies in <strong>Backend Development</strong> where I enjoy solving complex problems through code. I’m always eager to learn something new and explore the latest trends.

    <h2>🚴‍♂️💪 Beyond Code</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me in <code>isCold ? "Gym" : "one of Novi Sad's Street Workout parks"</code> pursuing my fitness goals. I love to improve my skills in the German language - what's your Duolingo streak, by the way? :) I also contribute to the <a href="https://nsbi.org.rs/en">Novi Sad Cycling Initiative</a> and enjoy solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">Rubik’s Cube</a> in my free time
