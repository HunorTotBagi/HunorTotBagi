    <h1>Hi, I'm Hunor 👋</h1>
      <p>
        I hold a <strong>Master's degree</strong> in Applied Mathematics, but my passion for problem-solving led me to the world of <strong>Software Development</strong>. I enjoy writing code in <strong>C#, Java, and Python</strong> with a particular interest in <strong>Backend Development</strong>, where I love solving problems through code. I'm always eager to learn new things, explore the latest trends and I am currently learning about microservices architecture.

    <h2>🚴‍♂️💪 Beyond Code</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you can find me in <code>isCold ? "Gym" : "one of Street Workout parks"</code> pursuing my fitness goals. I love to improve my skills in the German language - btw, what's your streak on Duolingo? :) I actively volunteer with the <a href="https://nsbi.org.rs/en">Novi Sad Cycling Initiative</a> and in my free time I enjoy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">speedcubing</a>
