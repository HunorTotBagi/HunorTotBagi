    <h1>Hi, I'm Hunor 👋</h1>

      I hold a <strong>Master's degree</strong> in <strong>Applied Mathematics</strong>, but my passion for problem-solving led me to the world of <strong>Software Development</strong>. With hands-on experience in <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>, I specialize in <strong>Backend Development</strong> and I am driven by clean architecture, continuous learning, and a strong focus on writing clean, maintainable code.
